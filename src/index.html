        <h2>The Trouble with Bears</h2>
        <p>
          Bears are a group of large mammals found throughout the world. They are known for their strength, intelligence, and adaptability.
        </p>
        <h3>Wild Bears</h3>

        <p>
          Wild bears can be found in forests, mountains, and arctic regions. They play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems.
        </p>
        <h3>Urban Bears</h3>

        <p>
          Occasionally, bears venture into urban areas in search of food. This can lead to encounters with humans, which are often dangerous for both parties.
        </p>
        <h3>Mating Rituals</h3>
        <p>
          Bears are solitary animals but come together during mating season. They have complex mating rituals, and males may compete for the attention of females.

          The following audio clip provides more details about bear mating rituals, along with samples and quotes from experts.

                  Oh, I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menaceâ€”I was thinking of putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.
